Write a shell script to check to see if the file "/etc/shadow" exists. If it does exist, display
"Shadow passwords are enabled." Next, check to see if you can write to the file. If you can,
display "You have permissions to edit /etc/shadow." If you cannot, display "You do NOT have
permissions to edit /etc/shadow."
